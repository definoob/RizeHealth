This medication is known as a PDE5 inhibitor. It helps relax blood vessels and improves blood flow to your penis to allow for a harder and longer-lasting erection. This medication is taken \\"as-needed\\", 30-60 minutes prior to intercourse.

Your photos and information will be stored securely and will only be shared with the patient support team and your doctor."}]},{"title":"Hair Loss","data":[{"question":"What medications do the doctors on the Rize platform prescribe for hair loss?","answer":"Physicians on the Rize platform prescribe the only two FDA-approved medications to treat hair loss; Finasteride (the generic form of Propecia\xae and Minoxidil (the generic form of Rogaine\xae).   Finasteride is an oral tablet taken once daily and requires a doctor\u2019s prescription. Rize 5% Extra-Strength Minoxidil in an over-the-counter topical solution used twice daily and applied directly to the scalp."},{"question":"What is Finasteride?","answer":"Finasteride is a prescription pill that is the generic form of the brand Propecia\xae and FDA-approved to treat the symptoms of male pattern hair loss.

Finasteride works on the hairline, crown, and vertex and is clinically proven to help slow down hair loss and in some cases lead to regrowth of hair."},{"question":"What is Minoxidil?","answer":"Minoxidil is an over the counter, FDA-approved topical solution that slows down hair loss and even promotes hair regrowth at the crown of your head. When consistently applied directly to the scalp twice a day, it can help you maintain a fuller head of hair."},{"question":"Do the hair loss treatments provided by Rize treat hair loss due to chemotherapy?","answer":"The Rize products (Finasteride and Minoxidil) treat hair loss caused by male pattern baldness.

By submitting photos of your head, the Rize licensed physicians can evaluate your current hair loss and provide you with the correct treatment."},{"question":"Are my photos kept secure?","answer":"Absolutely. Photos are only seen by your doctor to help them prescribe the appropriate treatment."},{"question":"Why do you need a photo of my government ID?","answer":"To legally prescribe medication, your doctor needs a photo of your driver\'s license or passport. We use your ID photo to verify your name and date of birth. Telemedicine laws require us to verify this information before we can prescribe medication. Your photos and information will be stored securely and will only be shared with the patient support team and your doctor."},{"question":"Why am I shedding more now when I just started treatment?","answer":"This is completely normal, and a good thing.  It shows that the new growth cycle is beginning, and the older hairs you may have lost are making way for the new healthy ones.  But don\u2019t worry, after 3-4 months of consistent daily use, many men will start to see a difference."},{"question":"Can I apply Minoxidil to wet hair?","answer":"The hair and scalp should be completely dry before applying Minoxidil."},{"question":"When should I apply Minoxidil?","answer":"Twice a day.  Once in the morning and once at night. When used at night, we recommend applying 2-4 hours before going to bed. This will ensure the solution is fully absorbed into your scalp and will not stain your linens."},{"question":"How long will each bottle of Minoxidil last?","answer":"Based on the recommended dose, approximately 30 days."},{"question":"Should I use a special shampoo while using Minoxidil?","answer":"A gentle shampoo is recommended but not essential."},{"question":"How long after I apply Minoxidil can I get my hair wet?","answer":"It\u2019s best to leave it in your hair for 4-6 hours to maximize its effects. Don\u2019t wash your hair for at least 4 hours after you apply it."},{"question":"Can I use a hair dryer after applying the treatment?","answer":"Avoid using hair dryers after applying minoxidil. It may make the treatment less effective because you\u2019re not giving your scalp the opportunity to absorb it."},{"question":"How long do I have to continue using Minoxidil?","answer":"If you want to maintain the hair regrowth, you need to keep using minoxidil. Once you stop using it, you may revert back to your pre-treatment scalp within six months. Also, you may notice an increased rate of balding once you stop. Minoxidil can slow down the balding process, so once you\u2019re off of it, your scalp functions without its effects anymore."},{"question":"Is it safe to use Minoxidil and Finasteride at the same time?","answer":"Yes, depending on your hair loss. It has actually been tested and proven more effective when used together to help stop hair loss and regrow new hair."}]}]')},,function(e,t,a){e.exports=a(66)},,,,,function(e,t,a){},,,function(e,t,a){},,,,,,function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t);var o=a(0),n=a.n(o),i=a(41),r=a.n(i),l=(a(57),a(58),a(59),a(60),a(1)),s=a(2),c=a(4),d=a(3),u=a(5),m=a(12),h=a(7),p=a(21),y=a.n(p),b=a(22),f=a.n(b),g=a(23),E=a.n(g),v=a(24),w=a.n(v),A=a(25),I=a.n(A),R=a(26),N=a.n(R),S=a(27),T=a.n(S),D=a(28),M=a.n(D),O=a(29),k=a.n(O),Y=a(30),j=a.n(Y),U=a(31),z=a.n(U),L=a(32),P=a.n(L),G=a(33),W=a.n(G),B=a(34),Z=a.n(B),C=a(35),x=a.n(C),F=a(36),J=a.n(F),Q=a(37),V=a.n(Q),H=a(38),X=a.n(H),q=a(39),K=a.n(q),_="https://staging-front.growhppy.com/#/",$=function(e){function t(e){var a;return Object(l.a)(this,t),(a=Object(c.a)(this,Object(d.a)(t).call(this,e))).state={opened:!1},a}return Object(u.a)(t,e),Object(s.a)(t,[{key:"onClick",value:function(){this.setState({opened:!this.state.opened})}},{key:"render",value:function(){var e=this,t=this.props.location.pathname,a=!0===this.state.opened?"show":"",o=!0===this.state.opened?"":"collapsed";return n.a.createElement("header",{className:"header navbar navbar-expand-lg"},n.a.createElement("div",{className:"container"},n.a.createElement(h.Link,{className:"my-0 mr-md-auto navbar-brand",to:"/"},n.a.createElement("img",{src:y.a,alt:"Rize Health LLC"})),n.a.createElement("div",{className:"header-right"},n.a.createElement("button",{className:"navbar-toggler "+o,type:"button",onClick:function(){return e.onClick()}},n.a.createElement("span",{className:"navbar-toggler-icon"},n.a.createElement("i",null))),n.a.createElement("div",{className:"navbar-collapse collapse navbarCollapse "+a},n.a.createElement("ul",{className:"nav navbar-nav mr-0 ml-auto"},n.a.createElement("li",{className:"/"===t?"active":""},n.a.createElement(h.Link,{to:"/"},"Home")),n.a.createElement("li",{className:"/rize_sex_life"===t?"active":""},n.a.createElement(h.Link,{to:"/rize_sex_life"},"Sex Life")),n.a.createElement("li",{className:"/rize_hairloss"===t?"active":""},n.a.createElement(h.Link,{to:"/rize_hairloss"},"Hair Loss")),n.a.createElement("li",{className:"/about"===t?"active":""},n.a.createElement(h.Link,{to:"/about"},"Why Rize?")),n.a.createElement("li",{className:"/rize_faq"===t?"active":""},n.a.createElement(h.Link,{to:"/rize_faq"},"Learn")),n.a.createElement("li",null,n.a.createElement("a",{href:_},"Order Now")))),n.a.createElement("ul",{className:"nav navbar-nav mr-0 ml-auto nav-right"},n.a.createElement("li",null,n.a.createElement(h.Link,{to:"#"},n.a.createElement("img",{src:f.a,alt:"userIcon"}))),n.a.createElement("li",null,n.a.createElement(h.Link,{to:"#"},n.a.createElement("img",{src:E.a,alt:"cartIcon"})))))))}}]),t}(o.Component),ee=Object(m.o)($),te=a(44),ae=a.n(te),oe=function(e){function t(){return Object(l.a)(this,t),Object(c.a)(this,Object(d.a)(t).apply(this,arguments))}return Object(u.a)(t,e),Object(s.a)(t,[{key:"render",value:function(){return n.a.createElement("footer",{className:"footer text-center"},n.a.createElement("div",{className:"container"},n.a.createElement("div",{className:"footer-brand"},n.a.createElement(h.Link,{className:"footer-logo",to:"/"},n.a.createElement("img",{src:ae.a,alt:"Rize Health LLC"})),n.a.createElement("ul",{className:"social-links"},n.a.createElement("li",null,n.a.createElement(h.Link,{to:"#"},n.a.createElement("i",{className:"fa fa-facebook"}))),n.a.createElement("li",null,n.a.createElement(h.Link,{to:"#"},n.a.createElement("i",{className:"fa fa-twitter"}))),n.a.createElement("li",null,n.a.createElement(h.Link,{to:"#"},n.a.createElement("i",{className:"fa fa-instagram"}))))),n.a.createElement("ul",{className:"footer-menu"},n.a.createElement("li",null,n.a.createElement(h.Link,{to:"/about"},"About Rize")),n.a.createElement("li",null,n.a.createElement(h.Link,{to:"/contact"},"Contact")),n.a.createElement("li",null,n.a.createElement(h.Link,{to:"/rize_faq"},"FAQ")),n.a.createElement("li",null,n.a.createElement(h.Link,{to:"/terms_and_conditions"},"Terms & Conditions")),n.a.createElement("li",null,n.a.createElement(h.Link,{to:"/privacy_policy"},"Privacy Policy")),n.a.createElement("li",null,n.a.createElement(h.Link,{to:"/privacy_practices"},"Privacy Practices")),n.a.createElement("li",null,n.a.createElement(h.Link,{to:"/telehealth_consent"},"Telehealth Consent"))),n.a.createElement("p",{className:"copyright-text"},"The clinical services offered through this website are provided by Techmd Medical Group, P.A., an independent, physician-owned medical group.
